# Dotfiles

Dotfiles managed using GNU Stow.  All dotfiles are in a single directory `~/dotfiles`, then symlinked into the expected locations.

To apply config for a "package" use

``` shell
stow --no-folding <name>
```

The `--no-folding` argument prevents stow from symlinking root directory but have it create it in the target directory.  Temporary files generated by the package will not polute the config repostiory then.

Old dotfiles are available at https://github.com/Fuco1/dotfiles-old
